# Image processing:MSE-PSNR-and-Intensity-Look-up-table

To find :-
1. Mean squared error (MSE)
2. Peak signal to nosie ratio (PSNR)
3. Intensity Lookup table

<pre>
For Intensity Lookup table we plot accordingly :
  a. in the top left axes, show the colormap functions of all color channels with the corresponding color.
  b. in the bottom left axes, show the image histogram with the same x-axis limits of the colormap functions.
  c. in the top right axes, show the image with the colormap
  d. in the bottom right axes, show the image using the default linear mapping with the display range the same as the index value range
</pre>
